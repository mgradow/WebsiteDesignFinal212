        <p>Just because it's winter doesn't mean riding is out forever. Even during December though march, there are clear, sunny days without wind that also make it great to ride in. All of these elements can cause for a good day to ride in when it's cold. </p>
        <P>As long as you are bundled up and can (for the most) flexibly move, you can go a fair distance. For example I like to ride my motorcycle to my work, which is 17 minutes away, while the sun is out and it makes for a good time. During those winter months, that itch of yours will nag at you like crazy.</P>

            <aside><p>Another additional tip would be to let your bike completely warm up before you go out riding. Whether it be an air-cooled motorcycle or a liquid cooled, they both needs to eb well lubricated and warm on the inside to ensure nothing will be damaged. Winter also makes for a great time to fix up your bike or add modifications to show off next year when you're back off to comfortable warm riding.</p></aside>
