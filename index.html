        <center><h2>Why do people ride motorcycles year round?</h2></center>
        <p>Riding in warm weather is arguably the best, and for most that's the only weather they'll ride in. But those, such as myself, want to extend the riding season as far out as they can. Now you may ask, "Why?" and to answer that, I don't have a solid answer other than people find it a lot of fun. Riding, regardless of conditions, is an addictive hobby that scracthes exactly the right itch... and with the right gear, you can still maintain being warm and comfortable as if summer were still around. The biggest change would be the road conditions such as ice and snow. Some would find that all the more fun. So what are the tips for being able to treck through colder temperatures? You'll find those on the next couple of pages in the 'Nav' bar above. </p>

            <aside><p>In this picture, we have an adventure bike that it best suited for riding in all four seasons. This motorcycle comes from the factory with heated grips, possible heated seat, and a wind screen to help curb all the wind that would otherwise hit your chest. They are essentially a very expensive dirt bike that is geared to take you anywhere with its head up high.</p></aside>
