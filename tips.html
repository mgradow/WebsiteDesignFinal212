        <p style=" font-size: xx-large;">Even if you have all the gear, always be realistic with what the circumstances are. If it's unsafe to ride, take your car and value both your saftey and the condition of the bike. Nothing hurts worse than dropping your bike when it's out of your control. Always ride responsibly and don't take a risk if you don't have to.</p>
        <p style=" font-size: x-large;">Most times, below freezing is not adequate for two wheels. Ice in a car is bad enough and a bike is a lot worse. Unlike a car, you don't have a cage around you to protect from sliding into a tree. If that's not bad enough, you're hands and feet and start to umb after prolonged riding. Your hands and feet are what control the bike, now I'm sure you can imagine what would happen. Nonetheless, don't be a Dummy!</p>

                <h2 style="margin-left: 10px; color: #A4DFF5;">Tip 1 - Staying Warm</h2> <p style=" font-size: medium;">Before setting out to go ride, you'll want to prepare for the cold. A great way to do so is by purchasing Base Layers for your body. These go underneath your clothes and help trap your body heat. On top of these base layers, you'll want to try and wear a windbreaker material over your regular clothes, or else the wind will pass right through whatever you're wearing. Lastly, heated gear is by far the greatest way to maintain being comfortable. Gloves would be a must if you plan to ride in the lower 30's.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 10px; color: #A4DFF5;">Tip 2 - Knowing When to Ride</h2> <p style=" font-size: medium;">Riding below zero is always an option, but rarely a safer one. With freezing temperature, you have ice and salt on the roads. Both of these can impair the control of the motorcycle and end up in an accident. If there is snow, make sure the bike and tires you have are appropriate in getting over the terrain. An good example would be an Adventure motorcycle with offroad tires (reference to the picture on the home page). A bad example would be a sportbike with summer road tires. The biggest part to knowing is planning ahead.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-left: 10px; color: #A4DFF5;">Tip 3 - Quicker Exhaustion</h2> <p>Before heading out on any long trips, make sure you plan some rest stops ahead. Riding in the cold weather forces your body to work harder and thus making you exhausted faster. Even the cold dry weather and dehydrate you like the hot weather.</p>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 10px; color: #A4DFF5;">Tip 4 - Riding Habits</h2> <p>When riding in the elements, there are extra precautions to take that could keep you up on two wheels. One of those being following distance and staying in the tire tracks made by other cars.</p>
